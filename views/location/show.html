<h1>Location.show</h1>

<p>Render HTML to have current location shown (for seo purposes)</p>
<p>
Backbone calls /location/:id route, this then needs to set the display to be the same as if navigated to, and try and load additional data in background.
Backbone will need to check when hitting route if bootstrap JSON = path="/location" or content on page, then it will know it was native, rather than navigated to so wont try an fetch the data again.
Possibly use bootstrap to populate model
